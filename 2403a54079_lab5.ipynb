So many state-of-the-art 3D detection algorithms dedicate in fusing\\nthese two types of data effectively. However, their fusion methods based on\\nBirds Eye View (BEV) or voxel format are not accurate. In this paper, we\\npropose a novel fusion approach named Point-based Attentive Cont-conv\\nFusion(PACF) module, which fuses multi-sensor features directly on 3D points.\\nExcept for continuous convolution, we additionally add a Point-Pooling and an\\nAttentive Aggregation to make the fused features more expressive. Moreover,\\nbased on the PACF module, we propose a 3D multi-sensor multi-task network\\ncalled Pointcloud-Image RCNN(PI-RCNN as brief), which handles the image\\nsegmentation and 3D object detection tasks. PI-RCNN employs a segmentation\\nsub-network to extract full-resolution semantic feature maps from images and\\nthen fuses the multi-sensor features via powerful PACF module. Beneficial from\\nthe effectiveness of the PACF module and the expressive semantic features from\\nthe segmentation module, PI-RCNN can improve much in 3D object detection. We\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the PACF module and PI-RCNN on the KITTI 3D\\nDetection benchmark, and our method can achieve state-of-the-art on the metric\\nof 3D AP.\",\n          \"Recently there has been a lot of work on pruning filters from deep\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the intention of reducing\\ncomputations.The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion\\n(say, l1-norm) and retain only the top ranked filters. Once the low scoring\\nfilters are pruned away the remainder of the network is fine tuned and is shown\\nto give performance comparable to the original unpruned network. In this work,\\nwe report experiments which suggest that the comparable performance of the\\npruned network is not due to the specific criterion chosen but due to the\\ninherent plasticity of deep neural networks which allows them to recover from\\nthe loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned.\\nSpecifically we show counter-intuitive results wherein by randomly pruning\\n25-50% filters from deep CNNs we are able to obtain the same performance as\\nobtained by using state-of-the-art pruning methods. We empirically validate our\\nclaims by doing an exhaustive evaluation with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also\\nevaluate a real world scenario where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes\\nneeds to be tested on only a small set of classes at test time (say, only\\nanimals). We create a new benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such\\nclass specific pruning and show that even here a random pruning strategy gives\\nclose to state-of-the-art performance. Unlike existing approaches which mainly\\nfocus on the task of image classification, in this work we also report results\\non object detection and image segmentation. We show that using a simple random\\npruning strategy we can achieve significant speed up in object detection (74%\\nimprovement in fps) while retaining the same accuracy as that of the original\\nFaster RCNN model. Similarly we show that the performance of a pruned\\nSegmentation Network (SegNet) is actually very similar to that of the original\\nunpruned SegNet.\",\n          \"This paper tries to give a gentle introduction to deep learning in medical\\nimage processing, proceeding from theoretical foundations to applications. We\\nfirst discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including\\nseveral major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the\\nfundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some\\nfundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the\\nreasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously\\nmedical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected\\nby this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image\\nsegmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also\\nrecent trends in physical simulation, modelling, and reconstruction that have\\nled to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior\\nknowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These\\napparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep learning.
